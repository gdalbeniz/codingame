The game takes place in a potion shop, in which two twin-sister witches are trying to prove they are the better potion brewer.
They have set up a contest: make more rupees selling potions than your sister.
However, the witch's hut in which they set up shop is quite small, so they must share the same workspace, and deal with the same client orders.

 	Rules
Each player controls a witch, each witch has access to their own inventory of potion ingredients and a list of spells they have learnt. These spells can be used to turn a certain set of ingredients into another.
Each client order is a list of ingredients required to brew a potion and earn some rupees.

The game is played over several rounds. Each player performs one action each turn, simultaneously.

Ingredients
There are 4 tiers of ingredient, indexed from 0 to 3 .


Higher tier ingredients are typically necessary in more expensive potion recipes but take longer to acquire.
A witch's inventory can contain up to 10 ingredients.

Each witch starts with 3 tier-0 ingredients in their inventory.

The inventory is represented by inv: 4 numbers each representing the amount of each ingredient tier.


If inv0 is 3 then you have 3 tier-0 ingredients.
Action overview
Each round, you can perform one of the following actions:

Learn a new spell from the magic tome.
Cast one of the spells you have learnt.
Rest to refresh all previously cast spells.
Brew a potion to score points.
You may also opt to skip a turn with the WAIT command.

Casting Spells
Spells have a delta: 4 numbers, one for each ingredient tier.
Positive numbers represent the amount of ingredients that are produced by the recipe.
Negative numbers represent the amount of ingredients that are consumed by the recipe.
For instance, a spell marked -1,1,0,0 means it can turn one tier-0 ingredient into a tier-1 ingredient.


This spell produces a tier-3 ingredient out of a tier-0 and tier-1 ingredient.
You may learn any number of spells during the game, but once you have cast a spell, it becomes exhausted. You may not cast exhausted spells.

Some spells are repeatable, meaning they can be used multiple times on the same turn before becoming exhausted.

The same four basic spells are always available at the start of the game. Use them to build up your repertoire of more efficient spells.

Some spells do not consume ingredients, they simply produce new ingredients.

Each player spell has a unique id and can be cast with the CAST id command.

Choose the number of times to cast a repeatable spell with the CAST id times command.


Learning Spells
The magic tome the witch sisters are using is quite volatile. Once a witch has memorised a spell, that spell disappears from the tome completely and is no longer available to the other witch.

To preserve a sense of fairness in their sisterly spat, the witches have devised a system:

They may only read from the first 6 available spells on each round.
The first spell in the list may be learnt freely.
To gain the right to memorise any spell further along in the list, they must put down a "read-ahead tax" by placing one tier-0 ingredient upon each spell that appears earlier in the tome.
For instance, if you want to learn the 4th spell in the tome, you must place a tier-0 ingredient on the first, second, and third.
You may only do this if you can afford it.
Whenever they memorise a spell with ingredients placed upon it, they also acquire those ingredients, which become usable on the next turn. If the witch's inventory is full, the excess is discarded.

Example of a learn action with a read-ahead tax.
The read-ahead tax is applied after learnt spells have disappeared from the tome, meaning new spells may be present in the 6 available when the ingredients are placed.

The tome is not infinite, there are exactly 42 spells within.

Each tome spell has a unique id and can be learnt with the LEARN id command.

Resting
Resting lets you channel your magic, rendering all exhausted spells available again for casting.

You can order your witch to rest with the REST command.

Brewing
Client orders have a delta: 4 numbers, one for each ingredient tier.
Negative numbers represent the amount of ingredients that are consumed by the recipe.
Therefore, the numbers are never positive because they represent a loss of ingredients from your inventory.

For instance, a client order with delta = -2, -1, 0, 0 means you have to consume 2 tier-0 ingredients and 1 tier-1 ingredients from your inventory in order to brew the potion.

The selling price of the client order is the amount of rupees will you earn by completing it.


This potion requires five ingredients and is worth 10 rupees. delta0 is -2, so you need at least 2 tier-0 ingredients in the inventory. Check this with the inv0 variable.
The client orders are queued up from left to right. Only five clients can fit inside the hut so a maximum of 5 orders will be available every turn.

You may deliver a potion for any of the clients within the hut, but the clients near the end of the queue (the left-most client orders) may earn you an urgency bonus. The bonus works as follows:

Brewing a potion for the very first client awards a +3 rupee bonus, but this can only happen 4 times during the game.
Brewing a potion for the second client awards a +1 rupee bonus, but this also can only happen 4 times during the game.
If all +3 bonuses have been used up, the +1 bonus will be awarded by the first client instead of the second client.
At the start of each new turn, new orders are queued up to fill the missing spaces.

Each order has a unique id and can be undertaken with the BREW id command.

‚õî Game end
The game ends once at least one witch has brewed 6 potions.

The game stops automatically after 100 rounds.

Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory.

Victory Conditions
The winner is the player with the most rupees.
Defeat Conditions
Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the commands is unrecognized.

 	Technical Details
When both witches perform the same action, they both reap the rewards for that action. This applies namely to potion prices, the urgency bonus, the read-ahead tax, and learning spells.
If both witches complete an order with an urgency bonus, two bonuses of that bonus level are consumed. If there is only one, it is consumed and both witches still get the same rewards.
The order in which spells appear in the tome is random. However, the list of all possible spells is always the same.
After learning a spell, the learnt version of the spell has a different id from the one previously within the tome.
You can check out the source code of this game on this GitHub repo. You can find a list of all possible spells in the tome.
A witch cannot obtain an ingredient from the tome on the same turn as it is placed there by the other witch.
If the absolute final spell is learnt on the same turn as a read-ahead tax is applied, the extra tier-0 ingredient is discarded.
